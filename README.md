**Context:** I am a Peer Collaborator/Teacher's Assistant for an Intro to Computer Programming, and after seeing a need for a simpler way of leveraging graphics in the student's final projects, I have decided to create these small JavaFX notes, in order to easier teach the concepts and code of JavaFX to students who are just starting out their programming journey.

**Goals:** 
- Create a simple set of interactive notes for JavaFX graphical elements
- Create copy-and-pasteable code that a student can directly use in their own code, using these notes as a micro framework, in order to not have to focus on learning JavaFX, and instead apply what they learned like the if statements, for-loops, arrays and etc.
- Focus on a creating teach-along style notes, in order to make it easier to for students to understand, and for the teacher to teach. 

**Features:**
- Simple Demonstrations of the most basic JavaFX nodes, required to make almost every kind of game
- More advanced techniques, like Mouse/Keyboard listeners, and various movement modes

These notes were a part of an Intro to JavaFX mini-cirriculum developed by me for the High School Intro to Computer Programming class. The class was taught the basics of GUI development, in hopes of providing them with tools necessary for them to make a final project that they want to, like a game. Semester 2 of 2022 was the first semester that was taught using this newly developed cirriculum, and it has yielded great results in both student learning and enjoyment. These notes are only the first iteration, and are planned to be developed further in the future, in order to make them clearer and mroe robust.
